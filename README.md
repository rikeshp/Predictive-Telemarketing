# Predictive-Telemarketing
Built decision tree classifier using Python (scikit-learn) to impove bank telemarketing by predicting whether or not a client will subscribe to a term deposit following a telemarketing call (binary classification). Resulted in 84% recall, meaning that this model accurately predicted 85% of total relevant results.

Used Jupyter Notebooks to demo this project to Analytics Team at Urban Outfitters, Inc, highlighting the results and how they can be useful to an actual bank.
